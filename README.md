# Voir

**Voir** is a tiny Swift framework designed to offer a fully functional and easy-to-use MVVM architecture for iOS app development, tailored for the braves who are still relying on UIKit.

The name **‚ÄúVoir‚Äù** originates from the French word meaning **‚Äúto see‚Äù**, reflecting its objective of enhancing the visibility and clarity of your app's architecture.

This project was initiated to support a presentation at a conference that centers around delivering insightful topics to the tech community. The central theme of my talk is:

```swift
Elegant Development: poetry and beauty in Swift code.

MVVM is a popular architectural pattern that helps developers organize their codebase, improve testability, and enhance collaboration between team members. |

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: Voir provides a solid foundation for implementing the MVVM architecture in your iOS apps. It separates concerns by dividing the application logic into three main components: Model, View, and ViewModel.

- **Reusable Components**: The package introduces reusable components such as `VoirComponent` and `VoirModel`, making it easier to structure your app's UI and business logic.

- **Lifecycle Observations**: Voir provides built-in lifecycle observation mechanism that automatically notify its components. This feature aids in efficiently managing resource allocation and deallocation. This aspect of Voir almost eliminates the need for touching a UIViewController again, as the `VoirController` efficiently relays all of its lifecycle events to both `VoirComponent` and `VoirModel`.

- **Builder Patterns**: The framework includes builder patterns (`VoirBuilder` and `ConstraintsBuilder`) that simplify the process of constructing complex UI hierarchies and defining layout constraints. Together, these patterns provide a beautiful domain-specific language (DSL) that not only enhances your code's aesthetics but also makes it completely understandable and easy to maintain when designing, positioning, and configuring UI elements.

- **View Controller Helper**: With the `viewController` property extension on `UIView`, you can easily find the parent UIViewController of any view, aiding in navigation and communication within your app.

## Usage

1. To integrate Voir into your project, simply include the framework as a Swift package.
2. There is also a `.xctemplate` to easily create a Voir MVVM Scene. Check the recording below üëá

## Template Installer

*TemplateInstaller* is a small Swift command-line interface tool whose sole purpose is to copy the `Support/Voir Scene.xctemplate` to the necessary destination, enabling the template to appear in Xcode's `File > New` selection window.

**1)** On your terminal, inside the cloned project folder, just run:

```bash
swift run
```

**or 2)** Prefer the manual labor?

```bash
XCPATH="~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Application/"
mkdir -p "$XCPATH"
cp "Support/Voir Scene.xctemplate" "$XCPATH"
```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the `DemoApp` inside `Support/` folder in the repository.

## DemoApp

Checkout **DemoApp.xcproject** at `Support/VoirDemo` folder. It has a small demonstration on how you can take advantage of every feature Voir can offer.
