# Voir

Voir is a Swift framework designed to provide a fully functional and easy-to-use MVVM architecture for iOS app development for the braves still relying on UIKit.

The name **‚ÄúVoir‚Äù** comes from the French word meaning **‚Äúto see‚Äù** reflecting its goal of enhancing the visibility and clarity of your app's architecture.

This project was created to support a presentation at a conference focused on delivering useful topics to the tech community. The theme of my talk is:

MVVM is a popular architectural pattern that helps developers organize their codebase, improve testability, and enhance collaboration between team members. |

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: Voir provides a solid foundation for implementing the MVVM architecture in your iOS apps. It separates concerns by dividing the application logic into three main components: Model, View, and ViewModel.

- **Reusable Components**: The package introduces reusable components such as `VoirComponent` and `VoirModel`, making it easier to structure your app's UI and business logic.

- **Lifecycle Observations**: Voir provides built-in lifecycle observation mechanism that automatically notify its components. This feature aids in efficiently managing resource allocation and deallocation. This aspect of Voir almost eliminates the need for touching a UIViewController again, as the `VoirController` efficiently relays all of its lifecycle events to both `VoirComponent` and `VoirModel`.

- **Builder Patterns**: The framework includes builder patterns (`VoirBuilder` and `ConstraintsBuilder`) that simplify the process of constructing complex UI hierarchies and defining layout constraints.

- **View Controller Helper**: With the `viewController` property extension on `UIView`, you can easily find the parent UIViewController of any view, aiding in navigation and communication within your app.

## Usage

1. To integrate Voir into your project, simply include the framework as a Swift package.
2. There is also a `.xctemplate` to easily create a Voir MVVM Scene. Check the recording below üëá
